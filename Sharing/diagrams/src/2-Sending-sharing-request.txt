title Sending a sharing request

participant Alice's Cozy as AC
participant Recipient's Cozy as BC

AC->+AC: Sharing request

AC->AC: Compute filter and documents list
note over AC:
At this stage the "sharing process" will have to:
* compute the list of documents to send (their ids);
* compute, if need be, the filter that led to the
aformentioned list.
end note

AC->AC: Create sharing document
note over AC:
* sharing id (generated by Couch upon creation)
* type (master-master/master-slave/one-shot)
* owner = True (we specify that Alice is the owner)
end note

AC->AC: Add "shareID" to\nshared documents
note over AC:
Applications need to be able to show
if a document is shared. Hence this field.
It also gives the sharing id.
end note

loop For each recipient
AC->AC: Generate pretoken
note over AC:
The "pretoken" is used to authenticate any
reply made by the recipient.
It is only used when initiating the sharing.
end note

AC->AC: Check if recipient has an access

alt Recipient doesn't have an access

AC->AC: Check if Recipient's contact exist
alt Recipient's contact doesn't exist
AC->AC: Create Recipient's contact
end

AC->AC: Create Recipient's access document
note over AC:
* URL (if specified)
* E-mail (if specified)
* contact id
* initialize list of sharings: [{sharing id, filter, pretoken}]
end note


else Recipient has an access
AC->AC: Update Recipient's\naccess document
note over AC:
Add to the list of sharings the information
relative to this one:
{sharing id, filter, pretoken}
end note
end

AC->AC: Add contact id to sharing document

AC->AC: Generate sharing request
note over AC:
* Alice's URL
* filter
* pretoken
* list of ids of shared documents
* type
* sharing id
* description
end note

alt Type is Master-Master
AC->AC: Add list of recipients\nto request
note over AC:
The sharing request will also contain the list of all
the recipients since they all have the same rights
on the documents shared.
end note
end // alt "Type is Master-Master"


alt E-mail
AC->AC: Send request by e-mail
note over AC:
See diagram "2.1-Receiving-request-by-mail"
end note

else URL
AC->BC: Send request
note over BC:
See diagram "3-Replying-sharing-request"
end note
end // alt E-mail else URL
end // Loop For each recipient

deactivate AC
