note over AC
We have to compute the entire list of documents
to share in order to find all of them that
are already shared in "master-master" type.
Indeed if one was to reshare such document, the
modifications made in one sharing would impact
the other.

note over AC:
We display some feedback to explain why the sharing
was canceled and give the list of incriminated
documents.
We can also go back to the selection step while having
deselected said documents.
